# This is an example configuration file for Coverity report generators. It
# tells report generators how to generate reports. You can make and modify a
# copy of it for use in configuring a report generator.
#
# Its initial sections apply to all report generators. Later sections,
# marked with "#######" comments, are intended for specific report
# generators.
#
# This file is In YAML format, version 1.2. See
# https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html for documentation on the format.
# If you simply modify a copy of this file you probably do not need to
# know details about YAML, however, be aware that structure is
# determined by indentation, i.e., the number of spaces at the beginning
# of the line. Multi-line text should be placed inside double quotes ("").
#
# The YAML constructs used here are "mappings" or key: value pairs. Some
# mappings' values are file pathnames. Pathnames may use a slash or
# backslash, whichever is appropriate for the platform, as a separator.
# (Note that according to YAML's quoting rules, backslashes are not
# special unless they are in a character sequence enclosed in double
# quotes.) A relative pathname here is interpreted as relative to the
# directory containing this configuration file. If the configuration did
# not come from a file (e.g., was read on standard input), then the
# pathname would be relative to the report generator process's working
# directory.
